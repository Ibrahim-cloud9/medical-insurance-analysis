# Medical Insurance Cost Prediction Analysis 🏥

This project analyzes how personal health attributes (age, BMI, number of children, smoking status) influence medical insurance costs. Using a predictive formula derived from historical data, I performed sensitivity analysis to quantify the financial impact of each factor.

## 📂 Project Overview
* Goal : To determine which health factors contribute most significantly to insurance premium increases.
* Data Source : [Medical Cost Personal Datasets (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/mirichoi0218/insurance)
* Tools : Python (Variables, Control Flow, Mathematical Operations)

## 📊 Key Findings form Analysis
Based on the sensitivity analysis performed in the notebook:
1.  Age : Age is a linear driver of cost. Increasing age by 4 years raises the estimated cost by approx. $1,000
2.  BMI : There is a direct positive correlation between BMI and cost. An increase of 3.1 points in BMI results in a significant premium hike.
3.  Gender: In this specific dataset model, being Male results in a slightly lower baseline cost compared to Female (approx. -$128 difference), assuming all other factors are equal.
